ðŸš§ This project is under development ðŸš§
I dont recommend you to use it in production yet.

Nexys is a logging service that will enable to review your errors, metrics and much more in production applications.\
Nexys will gather all device data automatically (screen size, user agent, device memory, language, connection type and geolocation if permitted)\
Also, Nexys will gather all errors on your production application, reports them to dashboard automatically.\
You can examine each error and log's stack trace, which file it occurred and many more details.

We currently support NextJS and React platforms. We will support NodeJS and React Native soon.
