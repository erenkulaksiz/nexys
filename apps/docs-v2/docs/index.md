ðŸš§ This project is under development ðŸš§
I dont recommend you to use it in production yet.

**Nexys** is a logging service that will enable to review your errors, metrics and much more in production applications.
**Nexys** will gather all device data automatically (screen size, user agent, device memory, language, connection type, geolocation if permitted, etc.)
Also, **Nexys** will gather all errors on your production application, reports them to dashboard automatically.
You can examine each error and log's stack trace, which file it occurred and many more details.

We currently support **NextJS**, **React** and **NodeJS** platforms.

**Nexys** collects your client's data by how you configured it. Nexys is highly customizable and can be configured to collect any data you want. You can collect user data, or you can send them anonymously, or you can send them both. **Nexys** is a **privacy-first** analytics platform, and we don't collect any data from your users without your permission.

## Focus on your product

We know that you want to focus on your product and not on analytics. That's why we made **Nexys** as simple as possible. You can integrate **Nexys** with your product in less than 5 minutes. You can use our [Javascript SDK](/installation).
