# Metrics

---

:::caution

This is an clientside feature.

:::

Metrics are the data that you want to collect from your users. You can collect any data you want. You can collect user data, or you can send them anonymously, or you can send them both. **Nexys** is a **privacy-first** analytics platform, and we don't collect any data from your users without your permission.

## Metrics are currently only available on `NextJS` platforms.

React and NodeJS support will come soon.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nextjs13" label="NextJS > 13" default>

## NextJS 13 or higher

Please read this [documentation.](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals)

You just need to replace line 7 with this `nexys.metric(metric)` on file `app/_components/web-vitals.js|ts`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nextjs12" label="NextJS < 13">

## NextJS 12 or lower

```tsx title="pages/_app.tsx"
import { nexys } from "../nexys";
import type { NextWebVitalsMetric, AppProps } from "next/app";

// Exporting function called `reportWebVitals` is required for NextJS to collect metrics.
export function reportWebVitals(metric: NextWebVitalsMetric) {
  // highlight-next-line
  nexys.metric(metric);
}

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This code will collect FCP (First Contentful Paint), LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), FID (First Input Delay), TTFB (Time to First Byte).

You can view your app metrics on your project's [dashboard](https://dash.nexys.app/) inside **Metrics** tab.

Also, if you dont want to collect metrics, just don't add `nexys.metric` to your project.
