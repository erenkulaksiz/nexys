ðŸš§ This project is under development ðŸš§
I dont recommend you to use it in production yet.

This library makes it easy to establish connection between your client and Nexys dashboard.

## How it works?

Nexys is a dashboard and client library that allows you to monitor your application logs and performance. It is a tool that helps you to understand how your application is performing and how it is behaving in production. You can view each user's detailed logs and performance data in a single place. Currently in beta and still being built.

Nexys will be available on these platforms soon:

- Web: React, NextJS
- Mobile: React Native
- Desktop: Electron
- Backend: NodeJS
